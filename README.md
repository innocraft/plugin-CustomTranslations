# Matomo Custom Translations Plugin

[![Build Status](https://github.com/innocraft/plugin-CustomTranslations/actions/workflows/matomo-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=4.x-dev)](https://github.com/innocraft/plugin-CustomTranslations/actions/workflows/matomo-tests.yml)

## Description

Lets you translate the following entities and tracked values into another language:

* Tracked [custom dimension](https://plugins.matomo.org/CustomDimensions) values
* Tracked event values
* Configured [custom dimension](https://plugins.matomo.org/CustomDimensions) names
* Configured [custom report](https://plugins.matomo.org/CustomReports) names
* Configured Dashboard names

This plugin does currently not let you change any already translated text in Matomo itself. You may be interested in
the [Customise Translations](https://plugins.matomo.org/CustomiseTranslations) plugin if you want to alter any translation.


Once you have installed and activated the plugin, go to "Administration => System => Custom Translations" to customise translations.
